## üí° Key Business Insights

- **Total revenue** generated was **‚Çπ1.7B**, with an average **occupancy rate of 58%** over 3 months.
- **Weekdays contributed 69% of revenue**, but **weekends had higher occupancy**, indicating scope for price-based demand balancing.
- **Mumbai led in revenue (‚Çπ669M)**, while **Delhi had the highest occupancy (60%)** and best customer ratings but only contributed 17% ‚Äî suggesting room for pricing review.
- **Occupancy % and customer ratings are positively correlated**, underscoring the need for high-quality service.
- **Elite rooms generated ‚Çπ554M**, showing strong demand for premium categories.
- **AtliQ Exotica (Mumbai)** and **AtliQ Palace** are top revenue-generating hotels ‚Äî both located in Mumbai.
- **Flat ADR across platforms and no weekday/weekend price difference** reflect missed opportunities for dynamic pricing strategies.
- **Direct bookings offered no pricing benefits**, which discourages margin-friendly channels.
- **Low-rated hotels** consistently suffer from **high cancellations and low occupancy**, negatively impacting revenue realization.
- **Hyderabad has the lowest ADR**, which may require a pricing reevaluation to match quality or brand value.

## üß† Strategic Recommendations

- **Introduce dynamic pricing models** based on day type, city demand, and room class to maximize ADR and occupancy during peak times.
- **Review ADR in low-performing cities like Hyderabad** to better align pricing with demand and property class.
- **Segment pricing for weekdays vs weekends**, as higher occupancy on weekends is not translating into proportional revenue.
- **Offer exclusive deals or loyalty benefits through direct booking channels** to increase profitability and reduce third-party commission dependency.
- **Prioritize service improvements** at properties with low ratings to improve occupancy and reduce cancellations.
- **Expand premium offerings**, given the high performance of elite rooms and top-tier properties in Mumbai.
- **Analyze demand elasticity** using RevPAR and ADR trends to create personalized promotions during off-peak periods.
